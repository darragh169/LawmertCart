* I need to learn why I used {createElement} vs React.Component
* I need to Learn to use Redux handleActions properly. 
* I really don't like the way I did the if quantity is less than 0, remove. I think it should be handled in the reducer but
I spent too much time trying to figure it out
* I tried to put Table into its own component but decided against it.
* I used Font Awesome Icons (but couldn't get the darker trash can to show up)
* I used Overpass from Googgle fonts
* I just ran 'npm run test' and I had too many lint errors, I should have been running it all day and now I don't have time to fix
